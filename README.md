# Execution-Analysis

Task Execution Analysis(IIIT-Hyderabad, Great learning)

Course Data Structures and Algorithms

This project is mainly focused on using Singly Linked List to perform analysis on the data. 
The dataset consists of the task_id, start_time and end_time for each task. In this project, you will be doing analysis and finding, minimum, 
maximum and average values execution time for inserted data in the form of linked list. You will also learn the operation to create, 
insert and read data in the linked list.

Skills and Tools

Ability to perform traverse and modify the singly linked list, 
Implementing methods in the LinkedList class.Performing analysis and finding min and max in execution time tasks from the created list.
Creating and inserting new data points in the linked list.
